### Building up the custom re-usable PHP framework

Before I started implementing the project, I had to think about how I can make the code the most reusable without using any third-party frameworks. The code also needs to be testable as I was planning to write unit tests on my code. So I decided to create my own PHP framework that is fully extensible and customisable without using any third-party libraries. My custom framework also includes the unit-testing feature. Inside the `App` folder sits business logic and domain logic and most of the application logic. All the unit tests and integration tests sit in the `Tests` folder. After we create a test class, we have to register the class in the `test.php` file as a new element of the `$unitTests` array. Another requirement is that all the test methods need to start with the "test" keyword.
As my framework supports the unit testing feature, I need to ensure that the classes are loosely coupled to each other and unit-testable by mocking them when needed. So I created my own IoC container which binds the abstraction classes with the concrete classes which provide the actual implementation of the application logic. You can find the IoC container class in the Container.php file which sits inside the project root folder.
The abstraction layer classes lie in the `App/Services/Abstraction` folder and the concrete classes which implement the respective interfaces are inside the `App/Services/Concrete` folder. Since the concrete classes are implementing the interfaces in the `App/Services/Abstraction` folder, we can provide the different implementations for the tests injecting the mock versions of the classes leveraging the Container class. The framework also supports `.env` file so that we can store the config variables and credentials in the `.env`. For the unit tests, it is using `.env.test` instead so that we can use the different values for the tests. The framework does not yet have its own routing system yet. When we access the project in the browser through `localhost`, it will always serve the content of the index.php in the root folder. Now it is not blocking any direct public access to other files in the project. We can do so by using `.htaccess` file in the future. My goal was to build an extensible and re-usable framework. But it was impossible to build a solid framework within the timeframe I have got. There are still rooms for improvement and features to be added.
If I was given enough time in the future, I can turn this into a solid PHP framework.
